## Hardware Interfaces for VR Applications: Evaluation on Prototypes
The paper starts off by speaking about how important it is to immerse the player into the game, it enables the player to feel part of the game and helps remember it. VR helps a lot in immersion as players have more ineraction with the game and they should be able to do this without explination but a lot of research needs to go into this so it all goes smoothly. I think this helps a lot with the game if it feels natural too you as makes it more enjoyable. The next section talks about the hardware and interfaces for VR that help immerse the player and how many different things you can use to do this depending on the type of game you want, thus showing you can make any sort of game and there are ways to make the player feel like part of the game. The author made two seperate games one using an xbox controller and one using a hyrda controller but both using a VR headset. Students evaluated them. The results showed that the students were confident in using the HMD of the oculous however before the tutorial session they had with the hydra controller they felt more comfortable using the standard xbox controller. The students who weren't doing a game degree said users should have knowledge before using the hydra controllers as it is something new not everyone is used, this is fair enough. The students found the game using the hydra controllers was more enjoyable and had a greater sense of immersion compared to the other game with the xbox controller because it was an action game it gave them motion sickness. The other game had a better interface for the users with the hydra controllers, this is a good point as research and tinkering has to go into VR games to reduce motion sickness. Overall this paper is trying to help us understand VR development.

## Exploitation of heuristics for virtual environments
This paper begins by suggesting that a patchwork of heuristics might be more useful than a single list, I agree with this because if you're evaluating things that vary significantly they shouldn't all be evaluated using the same heuristics. It goes on to discuss how they're doing a heuristics testic for crisis management in virtual reality. They look at the idea of comparing heuristics
proposed by Sutcliffe and Gault by looking at papers to see if they used the heuristics and if they found them useful.
