## Hardware Interfaces for VR Applications: Evaluation on Prototypes
The paper starts off by speaking about how important it is to immerse the player into the game as it enables the player to feel part of the game and helps remember it. It then says using VR helps a lot in immersion as players have more ineraction with the game and they should be able to do this without explination but it says a lot of research needs to go into this so it all goes smoothly.
